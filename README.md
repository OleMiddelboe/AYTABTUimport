**[All Your Transistors Are Belong to Us] - A computer built from discrete parts**

This is my attempt of building a complete computer using only discrete parts like transistors, diodes, capactitors and resistors.

Just to get warmed up a bit I've started designing an UART capable of transmiting and receiving serial data in 300 bps.

I plan to make proper PCBs for the boards that I require a lot of, like memory, registers and ALU-slices, but many of the more or less one-off boards will be made on standard donut-perfboard with thru-hole parts.
