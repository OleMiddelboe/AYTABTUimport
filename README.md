**[All Your Transistors Are Belong to Us] - A computer built from discrete parts**

This is my attempt of building a complete computer using only discrete parts like transistors, diodes, capactitors and resistors.

Just to get warmed up a bit I've started designig an UART capable of transmiting and receiving serial data in 300 bps.


I plan to make proper PCBs for the boards that I require a lot of, like memory, registers and ALU-slices, but many of the more or less one-off boards will be made on standard donut-perfboard with thru-hole parts.

I've used, collected, gleaned, stolen, borrowed and been inspired by the information on the following web sites:

Donut pcb layout creator - [code.google.com/p/diy-layout-creator/](https://code.google.com/p/diy-layout-creator/)  
Ring counter - [vk2zay.net/article/201](http://www.vk2zay.net/article/201)  
Asymetric multivibrator - [4qdtec.com/mvibs.html](http://www.4qdtec.com/mvibs.html)
